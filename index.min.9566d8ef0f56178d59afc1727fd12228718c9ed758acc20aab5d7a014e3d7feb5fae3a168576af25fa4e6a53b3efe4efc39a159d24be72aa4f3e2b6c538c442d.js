You will write an approximately 0.5 page summary of the paper. This will include the key concepts and the findings. Identify the trade-offs made in the work. Not all solutions work everywhere - think where this solution will not work. Construct a situation where this solution will not work. What are the inefficiencies? How would you address them?

You will review only the primary assigned paper - not the additional papers. However, you are highly encouraged to read them. Each student is expected to ask at least one question in the Q/A session. You are not allowed to ask obvious questions and your questions must show you have understood the concepts.
