You will write an approximately 0.5 page summary of the paper. This will include the key concepts and the findings. Identify the trade-offs made in the work. Not all solutions work everywhere - think where this solution will not work. Construct a situation where this solution will not work. What are the inefficiencies? How would you address them? What are the open research questions? If you wanted to redesign the study, how would you?

Non-presenters
You will review only the primary assigned paper - not the additional papers. However, you are highly encouraged to read them. Each student is expected to ask at least one question in the Q/A session. You are not allowed to ask obvious questions and your questions must show you have understood the concepts. Your critical review is due at 10AM CST on the morning of the class. `}),e.add({id:4,href:"/S23-CSC6730/docs/syllabus/schedule/",title:"Schedule",description:`The schedule is tentative and will change. # Getting Started # Week 0 - Jan 12
